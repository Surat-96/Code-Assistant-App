Provide python code of Binary Search.,"'
Here is an example of binary search in Python:
```
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
This function takes an array `arr` and a value `x` as input, and returns the index of `x` in the array if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the range of indices to be searched in half until the value is found or the range is empty.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x = 3
print(binary_search(arr, x)) # Output: 2
```
In this example, `arr` is a list of integers, and `x` is the value we are searching for in the array. The function returns the index of `x` (which is 2) since it exists in the array.",,,2024-06-15 16:14:42.944885
